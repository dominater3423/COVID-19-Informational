   	  <h3>Purposes</h3>
      <p>This page was created to present information pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. The threat of the disease is serious, and must be approached with respect for everyone affected. The contents will include short summaries of crucial information, advice on dealing with the situation, and just general thoughts from yours truly. Below are some references, if you so wish to check them out.</p>
      <h3>Stay off the news</h3>
      <p>Please don't watch the news on tv or refresh CNN's webpage every half-hour. Richard Stallman put out a message on this topic, which I think was worded quite well:<br><br>>https://stallman.org/articles/dont-watch-covid-tv.html</p>
      <h3>Relax, do not panic</h3>
      <p>Panic, which has already done enough damage already, will not get us anywhere. If you're quanantined don't just sit around idly but do something with your time, play a video game, binge anime, read a book, etc. The panic, in my opinion, will cause more harm that the virus itself, don't make the situation worse. Most importantly though, stay safe and remember you're not the only person in this situation.</p>
