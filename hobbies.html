    <h3>On Passing Time</h3>
    <p>A title like that sounds like one of those treaties written by those old Greeks, it always went like on and then whatever they were talking about. In that aspect they were not very creative. I think most people today when they have to pass the time they immediately jump on their computers. While I don't condone this per se, I don't think there is some moral advantage for those that don't. Then the four main types of entertainment seem to be social media, youtube, video games, and tv.</p>
    <h3>YouTube</h3>
    <p>I think snoozing through hours of YouTube videos is one of the most brain dead activities that one can partake in. Nonetheless I was very guilty of this up until around the middle of eighth grade, I used to watch hours upon hours of idiotic videos. Don't do this. I can't really recommend any channels, there is only one that I track without guilt. Channels I would recommend: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Luke Smith</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Social Media</h3>
    <p>The only quality conversations I find online are on irc channels, message boards, and forums dedicated to some niche. The only one I ever use is that second one, though I never actually post. Since it is blasphemous to talk about sites such as that, I won't list them. Discover them for yourself.</p>
    <h3>Video Games</h3>
    <p>I used to play more video games, rarely nowadays. My favorite were fps/rpg games, like the borderlands franchise. If you've never played Borderlands 2 I'd recommend you give it a look. It's one of those games where you can sink hundreds of hours into and barley scratch the surface. Mods have also been developed for the game recently as well, so that fixes the balancing since it was a little broken. Game I'd recommend: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Borderlands/Borderlands 2/Borderlands the Pre-Sequel</li>
      <li>Witcher 3</li>
      <li>CSGO</li>
      <li>Overwatch</li>
      <li>Fallour 3/New Vegas</li>
      <li>Emulators, just in general</li>
      <li>Bioshock/Bioshock Infinite</li>
      <li>Rebooted Tomb Raider games</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>T.V.</h3>
    <p>I never really watch television, so I have no idea what's good. This only show I've watched in the past six months is Serial Experiment Lain, watch that. Also, Come and See, which that ending scene where the girl walked out of the woods with ONLY a tattered dress with blood dripping down her legs was, I can't really describe it. It's a graphic movie about the eastern front of WW2. Then also Gettysburg, another good movie. All of them were great, watch them if you're in to that kind of stuff.</p>
    <h3>My Additions</h3>
    <p>I would say that one should try to pursue hobbies and not get caught up on the entertainment listed above, but I mean that's the ideal. Here I'll redeem myself a little. During all the time we have inside pick up a hobby, learn how to 3d model, play chess, or whatever else that would interest you. I personally have read a lot over the past few days. Books I'd recommend include the following: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Neuromancer</li>
      <li>Atlas Shrugged</li>
      <li>Huckleberry Finn</li>
      <li>The Last Wish</li>
      <li>Book of Disquiet</li>
    </ol>
      <p>Many other more technical books too, but they don't really belong here. Just try to limit your time on the hobbies listed above, it's better for you in the long run.</p>
