      <h3>Little Nervous</h3>
      <p>I'm not going to pretend that I have any special insights about this virus. It scares me. What scares me more than the virus itself is if those conservatives I laughed at for all these years were actually right. No, I don't mean Republicans. I'm more referring to the people who always - am I allowed to swear here? - complain about the centralization of the economy and technology. If they're right then the economy is very fragile, if it goes it will cost millions of lives. Though that is a worst case scenario, I don't believe it will reach levels such as that. I heard experts were saying that the virus would infect somewhere between 30% and 70% of the worlds population. I don't think anybody can ever predict something such as this, so statements like this should be taken with a grain of salt. I'm doing the two things which are in my power, staying calm and not watching the news.</p>
      <h3>We are our Worst Enemies</h3>
      <p>I'm convinced that the virus itself isn't the biggest threat, but the economic consequences from it. The big companies, I don't think, can't hold out long being idle. It's insane that we're home. The virus is going to take its toll, you can't stop it at this point in our globalized world. The best approach would have been to continue just as things were, now we are almost guaranteed an economic crash maybe a depression. In other words, "the economy matters folks." It seems senseless to me because now we have to deal with both, while one could've been prevented. Notice as well how the closures were a slow process, people were reading about the virus in the newspapers not quite believing it's real. Then when it spread to other countries a few more people took notice, then more as things slowly started to close around them. The closure were NOT a rational, calculated move, but a panic.</p>
      <h3>What I'm Doing</h3>
      <p>Well, I'm not going to lie, I'm actually enjoying the time at home. I have read close to 1,000 pages just over the last five days alone. Who is John Galt? That quickly lost its novelty and welcomeness with me. I also picked up a Lain grammar textbook, maybe I'll get through it. I have a bad habit of starting something and then never going through with it. I don't think I'm alone in that regard though. The work has been very light, which I have no problem with. The course we're taking the in the morning, I never actually watched the videos or did the reading, basing my judgments just from the quiz questions left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. It's like the Democrats who say they'll improve the economy by deindustrializing the nation, raising taxes, and adding more regulations. I mean maybe they have a point, but don't go around lieing to people that this will somehow help it grow. I really hate the Republicans too now that I mention it, I mean how can they champion individual freedom while their "pro life." That's simply a funny contradiction when you look at it on paper.</p>
      <h3>Impact on Me</h3>
      <p>I'll do just fine, at least not any worst than I've ever been since I hit puberty. This was kind of the lifestyle I had been living for the past year, I don't know whether to be proud or ashamed of that. I don't see it as such a bad thing go, if at least a few people start to pursue hobbies because of their boredom you can't call the closure of schools all bad. I guess one could argue that most kids will go after hedonistic pursuits, be lazy, and get fat, but they were doing this anyway. Don't lose all faith in people, there are some good ones out there. If I may say so, I'M living proof of that. Funny Dominic, very funny.</p>
      <h3>Quote from a Book I Wouldn't Dismiss Outright</h3>
      <p>A self-propagating system is just a system that tends to promote its own survival and propagation.<br>"In any envirnoment that is sufficeniently rich, self-propaating systems will arise, and natural selection will lead to the evolution of self-propagating systems having increasingly complex, subtle, and sophisticated means of surviving and propaging themselves." - Anti-Tech Revoulution: Why and How, pg 43<br>Draw your own conclusions and don't try to fully grasp the consequences.</p>
